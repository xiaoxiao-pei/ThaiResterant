                        Each party shall pay its own costs and expenses in connection with
                        this Agreement and its activities hereunder. The rights and
                        obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be governed by
                        the laws of the Province of Ontario, and the applicable federal laws
                        of Canada, without giving effect to any principles that would apply
                        a different governing law. All disputes arising hereunder or in
                        connection with this Agreement, the Website and/or the Application
                        shall be resolved in the appropriate Federal or Provincial court
                        located solely and exclusively in Ontario. You hereby consent to
                        exclusive jurisdiction in Ontario, Canada, and agree not to raise
                        any defence of forum non conveniens or any similar defence. The
                        relationship between the parties under this Agreement is that of
                        independent contractors and neither shall be, nor represent itself
                        to be, the joint venture, franchiser, franchisee, partner, agent or
                        representative of the other party for any purpose whatsoever. This
                        Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
                        parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, but
                        shall not be assignable by You without TaliUp Inc.’s prior written
                        consent. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
                        unenforceable or invalid for any reason, or if any governmental
                        agency rules that any portion of this Agreement is illegal or
                        contrary to public policy, the remaining provisions, to the extent
                        feasible, will continue in full force and effect with such
                        unenforceable or invalid provision to be changed and interpreted to
                        best accomplish its original intent and objectives
